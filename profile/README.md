Welcome to the open source software repositories developed by members of Alex Pollen's lab (https://www.pollenlab.org/) at the University of California, San Francisco. We study genetic control of human brain evolution using single cell genomics, genome engineering, and stem cell models. On this page, you will find software tools for analyzing large single cell genomics datasets, tools for cross-species comparisons, and code to replicate analysis in the lab's published papers.

Note that repositories shown on this page are forked from the personal Github page of the lab member who is the main developer, so please post issues and submit pull requests on the original repository page.
